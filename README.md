## Project Learning Git & GitHub (for starting students)

### The goal of this project is to practice working with Git and GitHub and using the terminal

During the introduction weeks of the bootcamp, the command line, Git and GitHub are discussed. These tools are very important and will become a routine (believe it or not). But like with everything when learning to code: you have to practise. We will use a learning tool called Git-it to practice the Git commands. This offers an example project to work with the local and remote repositories, so that you can try various things without the risk of messing up your repository :smile:.

You can use this material to practise in the CodeWomen coding session. Make sure you ask for help from the women developers who are there to coach, in case you have questions.

We will work with **terminal commands** such as:  
* pwd
* mkdir
* cd *foldername*
* touch *filename*
* cd ..
* ls

and **Git commands** such as:  
* git init
* git add .
* git commit -m "*some message*"
* git push (to a remote GitHub repository)
* git status
* git diff
* git branch *branch_name*
* and many others
